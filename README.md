# Software Starter Template

Reusable AI-assisted software development template for starting new software, SaaS, AI, web, mobile, and technology projects.

This repository provides a shared operating system for coding agents such as Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex.

## How It Works

The project follows the lifecycle defined in:

`BUILD_FROM_ZERO.md`

Project progress is tracked in:

`PROJECT_STATE.md`

Important project context is stored in:

- `PROJECT.md` — what we are building and why
- `ROADMAP.md` — project milestones
- `DECISIONS.md` — important decisions and reasoning
- `BACKLOG.md` — deferred ideas and features

Agent-specific instructions:

- `AGENTS.md` — shared agent instructions / Codex
- `CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code instructions
- `.cursor/rules/build-process.mdc` — Cursor project rule

## Starting a New Project

1. Click **Use this template** on GitHub.
2. Create a new repository.
3. Clone the new repository.
4. Open the project in Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, or another coding agent.
5. Tell the agent:

> We are starting this project from scratch. Read the repository instructions and begin the BUILD_FROM_ZERO process.

The agent should:

1. Read the repository instructions.
2. Read `BUILD_FROM_ZERO.md`.
3. Read `PROJECT_STATE.md`.
4. Determine the current phase.
5. Work through the lifecycle one phase at a time.
6. Update project state as progress is made.

## Principle

The objective is not to maximize code output.

The objective is to make the next correct product decision, implement it safely, verify it, and continue until the product is ready for real users.
